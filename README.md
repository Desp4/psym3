## PSYM3
A rewrite in C of my first program
###### what?
It's a utility that fetches all the files with specified extensions from the directories, groups files with the same creation time together, shuffles those group and writes it to a file, which it can later read and extract each group by copying the files in their corresponding folders.
### Usage
I hope `psym --help` will make sense
### Building
It uses Windows API, you get the idea :)
